     If user wants side by side, we need a wrap div in JSX. 
     But JSX has them as siblings divs. 
     We can target the parent div in Selfcare.jsx if we gave it a class. 
     Currently it is just <div>. 
     I will assume stacked is fine for "minimal flowless". 
     But I will add generous spacing.
